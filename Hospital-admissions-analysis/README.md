# Forecasting and Monitoring Hospitalization Trends from Respiratory Viruses in Kenya  
(Using U.S. Government Data as a Proxy)

## Project Overview

Kenya faces challenges in tracking and predicting hospitalizations caused by respiratory viruses like COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV due to limited real-time health data. This project leverages publicly available hospitalization data from the United States (from CDC and HHS) as a proxy dataset.

Using this structured data, we build a pipeline to:
- Analyze hospitalization trends
- Engineer time series features
- Train forecasting models
- Evaluate prediction accuracy

These insights are designed to guide the development of similar systems in Kenya when comparable data becomes available.

## Project Structure

- `capstone_project_group_10.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing
- `Final_Model_Notebook.ipynb`: Model training, evaluation, and forecasting
- `/images`: Contains all output visualizations used below

---


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial exploration includes:
- Temporal trends by virus
- Hospital admissions by state and region
- Weekly patterns

---

## Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

To prepare the data for time series modeling:
- Lag features and rolling statistics were added
- Weekly grouping was applied
- Target variable was renamed for modeling compatibility
- SMA (Simple Moving Average) was also computed for benchmarking

---

## Machine Learning Models

We used Linear regression as our baseline model. Other models we used were random forest and XGBoost as shown below.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a scalable pipeline for forecasting respiratory-related hospitalizations. By using U.S. data as a stand-in, we can design robust forecasting systems that will be critical when similar healthcare infrastructure is developed in Kenya.
